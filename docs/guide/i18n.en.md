# Internationalization

antd-mini v3 supports internationalization of global settings, and multi-language support is realized by setting Locale. The component uses Chinese by default;

## Mode of use

1. Introducing components in the page JSON file`ConfigProvider` Components to globally configure multilingual files;

```json
{
  "usingComponents": {
    "ant-config-provider": "antd-mini/es/ConfigProvider/index"
  }
}
```

2. introduce the corresponding language source file into js

```js
import enUS from '@antd-mini/locales/en-US';
Page({
  data: {
    locale: esES,
  },
});
```

2. Used in AXML, it is important to note that the entire project is only passed for the first time.`ConfigProvider`Setting Locale will take effect globally. Different languages are set on different pages of the same project and will only take effect once;


```xml
<ant-config-provider locale={{locale}}>
  <ant-button>
      I am a button.
  </ant-button>
</ant-config-provider>
```
